Message-ID: <492FDED2.1080605@linuxsistem.com>

hi everyone,

I think have a problem  with missing python module named users.When I 
try to start weever.tac with twistd ,this error message appeared.

[localhost] src > twistd -oy weever.tac

Failed to load application: No module named users
[localhost] src >


also there are few lines from twistd.log file

from users import auth
exceptions.ImportError: No module named users
